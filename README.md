# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-with-Keras

## Objectives:

- Describe what a neural network is, what a deep learning model is, and the difference between them.

- Implement unsupervised deep learning models such as autoencoders, transformers and restricted Boltzmann machines.

- Demonstrate an understanding of supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent networks.

- Build deep learning models and networks using the Keras library.
